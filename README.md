# Neo Cypher

A PHP `~7.1` library to assist with the creation and mangement of [Neo4J Graph Database](http://neo4j.com/) Cypher queries.
This package implements a query builder and series of helpers that should feel familiar to those using `doctrine/orm`.

## Work In Progress

This is released under a `0` major version meaning the API could change dramatically. 
I am to get to a stable release as soon as I have managed to cover a good majority of the [Cypher Syntax](http://neo4j.com/docs/developer-manual/current/cypher/syntax/) described in their documentation.

## Usage

I will fully document this when its in a more stable state however the best place to get a grasp on how to use the library will be reading the tests.
